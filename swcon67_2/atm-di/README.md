# Dependency Injection

| 1. receive dependent object via constructor or setter 
| 2. Change implementation easier --- Layer of Indirection

- **Loosely coupled code**
#### Focus at composing objects / dependencies
- No "new" keyword in class definition

### ใช้เมื่อไร
- **Use DI** when dependencies (object) can be changed for different run
- *No need for DI* when dependencies won’t be changed with diff run
